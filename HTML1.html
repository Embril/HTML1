    <h4>Attributes</h4>

    <p>the a tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to</p>
    <P> the img tag is used to embed an image into the HTML page. THe src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed</P>

    <P> there are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute.</P>
    <p>1. absolute URL - links to an external image that is hosted on another website.</p>
    <p>2. relative URL - links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name.
        if the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page.
    </p>

    <p> the img tag should also contain the width and height attributes, whics specifies the width and height of the image (in pixels)</p>

    <p>the required alt attribute for the img tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. this can be due to slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader</p>

    <p> the style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.</p>

    <p>YOu should always use the lang attribute inside the html tal, to declare the language of the web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
        Country codes can also be added to the code in the lang attribute. So, the first two characters define the language of the html page, and the last two characters define the country.
        eks: html lang="en-US" English in the united states.
    </p>

    <P title="im a tootltip"> the title attribute defines some extra information about an element. The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element.
        EKS: title="i'm a tooltip"

    <h1>Headings</h1>
    <P>HEadings are important. Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.
        Users often skim a page by its headings. it is important to use headings to show the document structure.
        Each HTML heading has a default size. however, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS font-size property.
        eks: h1 style="font-size:60px;" 
    </P>


    <h2> HTML Paragraphs</h2>
    <p>The html p element defines a paragraph. 
        A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space ( a margin) before and after a paragraph.
    </p>

    <p> HTML Display. you cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed. Large or small screens and resized windows will create different results.
        With html, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your html code. 
        The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed.
    </p>

    <h3>HTML Horizontal rules</h3>¨
    <p>the hr tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule. 
        The hr element is used to seperate content (or define a change) in an html page:
    </p>

    <h1>eksample</h1>
    <p>eksample</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Eksample</h2>
    <p>Eksample</p>

    <p>HTML Line Breaks. The br element defines a line break. Use br if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph.</p>

    <p>THe HTML pre Element. the html pre element defines preformatted text. 
        the text inside a pre element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks.
